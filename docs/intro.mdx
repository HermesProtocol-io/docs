Welcome to the documentation of Hermes Protocol. These docs may become outdated over time. If you notice something strange, missing or outright wrong, let us know through our [Discord support server](https://discord.gg/Jxe32aaFE3).

Hermes Protocol is a platform with multiple intertwined parts. For its first phase, they work together to serve as a notifications system, 100% free for everyone. It allows anyone to receive instant alerts about on-chain events, such as wallet transactions (whale monitoring, for ex.), NFT purchases/bids/lists/etc., price alerts, governance polls, validator profile changes (commission %, name, etc.), and more...

## 🚩 Published Features

### 🔔 [Price Alerts](bot-commands/price-alert.mdx)

Through the **Price Alert** command, be notified about price changes of cryptocurrencies you're looking to buy or sell.

### 🏦 [Governance](bot-commands/governance.mdx)

With the **Governance** command, subscribe to governance polls created on the supported blockchains and their dApps as well.

### 🪙 [Get Price](bot-commands/get-price.mdx)

Instantly check coin prices with the **Get Price** command. Bonus: The **arbs** command bundles multiple prices together commonly searched for Arbitrage opportunities.

### 🧾 [NFT](bot-commands/nft.mdx)

The **NFT** command has multiple sub-commands so people can subscribe to sales/mints of entire NFT collections, or other actions like creating auctions, bids, listings, etc., or perhaps specify just a few NFT's they'd like to _snipe_, instead of entire collections.

### 💼 [Wallet](bot-commands/wallet.mdx)

The **Wallet** commands allow users to follow all transactions made to or from one or multiple wallets.
