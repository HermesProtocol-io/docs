For now, Hermes Protocol uses internal IDs manually generated for each blockchain, project, category and notification.
Eventually all IDs will be made available, easily accessible and human-readable, on our [Assets repository](https://github.com/HermesProtocol-io/assets) which has [its own documentation](https://assets.hermesprotocol.io/).
