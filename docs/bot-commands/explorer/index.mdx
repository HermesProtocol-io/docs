The Explorer feature is a functionality provided by our bots that enable users to access blockchain/ledger information directly. By using our commands, users can retrieve details about blocks (and their transactions), smart contracts (and their funds or available functions), NFTs (traits, image, owner, etc.), or individual transactions. This feature offers a convenient way for users to check blockchain information more quickly without having to leave the chat, or show-off an NFT or prove a certain TX was done.
